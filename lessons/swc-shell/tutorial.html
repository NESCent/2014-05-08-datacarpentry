  <p>
    Nelle Nemo,
    a marine biologist,
    has just returned from a six-month survey of the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre">North Pacific Gyre</a>,
    where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life
    in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a>.
    She has 1520 samples in all,
    and now needs to:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Run each sample through an assay machine that will measure the relative abundance of 300 different proteins.
      The machine's output for a single sample is a file with one line for each protein.
    </li>
    <li>
      Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately
      using a program her supervisor wrote called <code>goostat</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compare the statistics for each protein with corresponding statistics for each other protein
      using a program one of the other graduate students wrote called <code>goodiff</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write up.
      Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end of the month
      so that her paper can appear in
      an upcoming special issue of <cite>Aquatic Goo Letters</cite>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each sample.
    The good news is,
    it only takes two minutes to set each one up.
    Since her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel,
    this step will "only" take about two weeks.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bad news is,
    if she has to run <code>goostat</code> and <code>goodiff</code> by hand,
    she'll have to enter filenames and click "OK" roughly 300<sup>2</sup> times
    (300 runs of <code>goostat</code>, plus 300&times;299 runs of <code>goodiff</code>).
    At 30 seconds each,
    that will 750 hours, or 18 weeks.
    Not only would she miss her paper deadline,
    the chances of her getting all 90,000 commands right are approximately zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter is about what she should do instead.
    More specifically,
    it's about how she can use a command shell
    to automate the repetitive steps in her processing pipeline,
    so that her computer can work 24 hours a day
    while she writes her paper.
    As a bonus,
    once she has put a processing pipeline together,
    she will be able to use it again
    whenever she collects more data.

  <h2>Instructors</h2>

<div id="s:shell:instructors" class="instructors">

  <p>
    Many people have questioned whether we should still teach the shell.
    After all,
    anyone who wants to rename several thousand data files
    can easily do so interactively in the Python interpreter,
    and anyone who's doing serious data analysis
    is probably going to do most of their work inside the IPython Notebook or R Studio.
    So why teach the shell?
  </p>

  <p>
    The first answer is,
    "Because so much else depends on it."
    Installing software,
    configuring your default editor,
    and controlling remote machines frequently assume a basic familiarity with the shell,
    and with related ideas like standard input and output.
    Many tools also use its terminology
    (for example,
    the <code>%ls</code> and <code>%cd</code> magic commands in IPython).
  </p>

  <p>
    The second answer is,
    "Because it's an easy way to introduce some fundamental ideas about how to use computers."
    As we teach people how to use the Unix shell,
    we teach them that they should get the computer to repeat things
    (via tab completion,
    <code>!</code> followed by a command number,
    and <code>for</code> loops)
    rather than repeating things themselves.
    We also teach them to take things they've discovered they do frequently
    and save them for later re-use
    (via shell scripts),
    to give things sensible names,
    and to write a little bit of documentation
    (like comment at the top of shell scripts)
    to make their future selves' lives better.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally,
    and perhaps most importantly,
    teaching people the shell lets us teach them
    to think about programming in terms of function composition.
    In the case of the shell,
    this takes the form of pipelines rather than nested function calls,
    but the core idea of "small pieces, loosely joined" is the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of this material can be covered in three hours
    as long as learners using Windows do not run into roadblocks such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      not being able to figure out where their home directory is
      (particularly if they're using Cygwin);
    </li>
    <li>
      not being able to run a plain text editor;
      and
    </li>
    <li>
      the shell refusing to run scripts that include DOS line endings.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Here are some ways to approach this material:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>
      Have learners open a shell
      and then do <code>whoami</code>,
      <code>pwd</code>,
      and <code>ls</code>.
      Then have them create a directory called <code>bootcamp</code>
      and <code>cd</code> into it,
      so that everything else they do during the lesson
      is unlikely to harm whatever files they already have.
    </li>

    <li>
      Get them to run an editor
      and save a file in their <code>bootcamp</code> directory
      as early as possible.
      Doing this is usually the biggest stumbling block during the entire lesson:
      many will try to run the same editor as the instructor
      (which may leave them trapped in the awful nether hell that is Vim),
      or will not know how to navigate to the right directory
      to save their file,
      or will run a word processor rather than a plain text editor.
      The quickest way past these problems is to have more knowledgeable learners
      help those who need it.
    </li>

    <li>
      Tab completion sounds like a small thing: it isn't.
      Re-running old commands using <code>!123</code> or <code>!wc</code>
      isn't a small thing either,
      and neither are wildcard expansion and <code>for</code> loops.
      Each one is an opportunity to repeat one of the big ideas of Software Carpentry:
      if the computer <em>can</em> repeat it,
      some programmer somewhere will almost certainly have built 
      some way for the computer <em>to</em> repeat it.
    </li>

    <li>
      Building up a pipeline with four or five stages,
      then putting it in a shell script for re-use
      and calling that script inside a <code>for</code> loop,
      is a great opportunity to show how
      "seven plus or minus two"
      connects to programming.
      Once we have figured out how to do something moderately complicated,
      we make it re-usable and give it a name
      so that it only takes up one slot in working memory
      rather than several.
      It is also a good opportunity to talk about exploratory programming:
      rather than designing a program up front,
      we can do a few useful things
      and then retroactively decide which are worth encapsulating
      for future re-use.
    </li>

    <li>
      We have to leave out many important things because of time constraints,
      including file permissions, job control, and SSH.
      If learners already understand the basic material,
      this can be covered instead using the online lessons as guidelines.
    </li>

    <li>
      Installing Bash and a reasonable set of Unix commands on Windows
      always involves some fiddling and frustration.
      Please see the latest set of installation guidelines for advice,
      and try it out yourself <em>before</em> teaching a class.

  <h2>What and Why</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Draw a diagram to show how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.</li>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

<div id="s:shell:intro:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    At a high level, computers do four things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>run programs;</li>
    <li>store data;</li>
    <li>communicate with each other; and</li>
    <li>interact with us.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    They can do the last of these in many different ways,
    including direct brain-computer links and speech interfaces.
    Since these are still in their infancy,
    most of us use windows, icons, mice, and pointers.
    These technologies didn't become widespread until the 1980s,
    but their roots go back to Doug Engelbart's work in the 1960s,
    which you can see in what has been called
    "<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8734787622017763097#">The Mother of All Demos</a>".
  </p>

  <p>
    Going back even further,
    the only way to interact with early computers was to rewire them.
    But in between,
    from the 1950s to the 1980s,
    most people used a technology based on the old-fashioned typewriter.
    That technology is still widely used today,
    and is the subject of this chapter.

  <p>
    When I say "typewriter", I actually mean a line printer connected to a keyboard
    (<a href="#f:decwriter">Figure 1</a>).
    These devices only allowed input and output of the letters, numbers, and punctuation found on a standard keyboard,
    so programming languages and interfaces had to be designed around that constraint&mdash;though
    if you had enough time on your hands,
    you could draw simple pictures using just those characters
    (<a href="#f:ascii_art">Figure 2</a>).

  <p>
    Today,
    this kind of interface is called a <a href="glossary.html#clui">command-line user interface</a>,
    or CLUI,
    to distinguish it from the <a href="glossary.html#gui">graphical user interface</a>,
    or GUI,
    that most of us now use.
    The heart of a CLUI is a <a href="glossary.html#repl">read-evaluate-print loop</a>,
    or REPL:
    when the user types a command,
    the computer reads it,
    executes it,
    and prints its output.
    (In the case of old teletype terminals, it literally printed the output onto paper, a line at a time.)
    The user then types another command,
    and so on until the user logs off.
  </p>

  <p>
    This description makes it sound as though
    the user sends commands directly to the computer,
    and the computer sends output directly to the user.
    In fact,
    there is usually a program in between called a <a href="glossary.html#shell">command shell</a>
    (<a href="#f:command_shell">Figure 3</a>).
    What the user types goes into the shell;
    it figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    A shell is a program like any other.
    What's special about it is that its job is to run other programs,
    rather than to do calculations itself.
    The most popular Unix shell is Bash, the Bourne Again SHell
    (so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne&mdash;this
    is what passes for wit among programmers).
    Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix,
    and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows,
    such as <a href="http://www.cygwin.org">Cygwin</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using Bash,
    or any other shell,
    sometimes feels more like programming that like using a mouse.
    Commands are terse (often only a couple of characters long),
    their names are frequently cryptic,
    and their output is lines of text rather than something visual like a graph.
    On the other hand,
    the shell allows us to combine existing tools in powerful ways with only a few keystrokes,
    and to set up pipelines to handle large volumes of data automatically.
    In addition,
    the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines.
    As clusters and cloud computing become more popular for scientific data crunching,
    being able to drive them is becoming a necessary skill.

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

<div id="s:shell:filedir:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
    is called the <a href="glossary.html#file-system">file system</a>.
    It organizes our data into files,
    which hold information,
    and directories (also called "folders"),
    which hold files or other directories.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several commands are frequently used
    to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
    To start exploring them,
    let's log in to the computer by typing our user ID and password.
    Most systems will print stars to obscure the password,
    or nothing at all,
    in case some evildoer is shoulder surfing behind us.
  </p>

<pre>
login: <span class="in">vlad</span>
password: <span class="in">********</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Once we have logged in we'll see a <a href="glossary.html#prompt">prompt</a>,
    which is how the shell tells us that it's waiting for input.
    This is usually just a dollar sign,
    but which may show extra information such as our user ID or the current time.
    Type the command <code class="in">whoami</code>,
    then press the <span class="keyboard">Enter</span> key
    (sometimes marked <span class="keyboard">Return</span>)
    to send the command to the shell.
    The command's output is the ID of the current user,
    i.e.,
    it shows us who the shell thinks we are:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">whoami</span>
<span class="out">vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    More specifically,
    when we type <code>whoami</code>
    the shell:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>finds a program called <code>whoami</code>,</li>
    <li>runs it,</li>
    <li>waits for it to display its output, and</li>
    <li>displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Getting Around</h3>

  <p>
    Next,
    let's find out where we are
    by running a command called <code>pwd</code>
    (which stands for "print working directory").
    At any moment,
    our <a href="glossary.html#current-working-directory">current working directory</a>
    is our current default directory,
    i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in
    unless we explicitly specify something else.
    Here,
    the computer's response is <code class="out">/users/vlad</code>,
    which is Vlad's <a href="glossary.html#home-directory">home directory</a>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Alphabet Soup</h3>

    <p>
      If the command to find out <em>who</em> we are is <code>whoami</code>,
      the command to find out <em>where</em> we are ought to be called <code>whereami</code>,
      so why is it <code>pwd</code> instead?
      The usual answer is that in the early 1970s,
      when Unix was first being developed,
      every keystroke counted:
      the devices of the day were slow,
      and backspacing on a teletype was so painful
      that cutting the number of keystrokes
      in order to cut the number of typing mistakes
      was actually a win for usability.
      The reality is that commands were added to Unix one by one,
      without any master plan,
      by people who were immersed in its jargon.
      The result is as inconsistent as the roolz uv Inglish speling,
      but we're stuck with it now.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    To understand what a "home directory" is,
    let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized
    (<a href="#f:filesystem">Figure 4</a>).
    At the top is the <a href="glossary.html#root-directory">root directory</a>
    that holds everything else the computer is storing.
    We refer to it using a slash character <code>/</code> on its own;
    this is the leading slash in <code>/users/vlad</code>.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:filesystem">
    <img src="{{page.root}}/img/lessons/swc-shell/filesystem.png" alt="File System" />
    <figcaption>Figure 4: File System</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Inside that directory (or underneath it, if you're drawing a tree) are several other directories:
    <code>bin</code> (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
    <code>data</code> (for miscellaneous data files),
    <code>users</code> (where users' personal directories are located),
    <code>tmp</code> (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
    and so on.
    We know that our current working directory <code>/users/vlad</code> is stored inside <code>/users</code>
    because <code>/users</code> is the first part of its name.
    Similarly,
    we know that <code>/users</code> is stored inside the root directory <code>/</code> because its name begins with <code>/</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Underneath <code>/users</code>,
    we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine
    (<a href="#f:home_directories">Figure 5</a>).
    The Mummy's files are stored in <code>/users/imhotep</code>,
    Wolfman's in <code>/users/larry</code>,
    and ours in <code>/users/vlad</code>,
    which is why <code>vlad</code> is the last part of the directory's name.
    Notice, by the way, that there are two meanings for the <code>/</code> character.
    When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory.
    When it appears <em>inside</em> a name, it's just a separator.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:home_directories">
    <img src="{{page.root}}/img/lessons/swc-shell/home_directories.png" alt="Home Directories" />
    <figcaption>Figure 5: Home Directories</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Let's see what's in Vlad's home directory by running <code>ls</code>,
    which stands for "listing":
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">bin          data      mail       music
notes.txt    papers    pizza.cfg  solar
solar.pdf    swc</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order,
    arranged neatly into columns.
    To make its output more comprehensible,
    we can give it the <a href="glossary.html#command-line-flag">flag</a> <code>-F</code> by typing <code>ls -F</code>.
    This tells <code>ls</code> to add a trailing <code>/</code> to the names of directories:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    As you can see,
    <code>/users/vlad</code> contains seven <a href="glossary.html#sub-directory">sub-directories</a>
    (<a href="#f:vlad_homedir">Figure 6</a>).
    The names that don't have trailing slashes&mdash;<code>notes.txt</code>, <code>pizza.cfg</code>, and <code>solar.pdf</code>&mdash;are
    plain old files.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:vlad_homedir">

    <figcaption>Figure 6: Vlad's Home Directory</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>What's In A Name?</h3>

    <p>
      You may have noticed that all of Vlad's files' names are "something dot something".
      This is just a convention:
      we can call a file <code>mythesis</code> or almost anything else we want.
      However,
      most people use two-part names most of the time
      to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart.
      The second part of such a name is called the <a href="glossary.html#filename-extension">filename extension</a>,
      and indicates what type of data the file holds:
      <code>.txt</code> signals a plain text file,
      <code>.pdf</code> indicates a PDF document,
      <code>.cfg</code> is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to remember that this is just a convention.
      Files contain bytes:
      it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for PDF documents, images, and so on.
      For example,
      naming a PNG image of a whale as <code>whale.mp3</code>
      doesn't somehow magically turn it into a recording of whalesong.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Now let's take a look at what's in Vlad's <code>data</code> directory
    by running the command <code>ls -F data</code>.
    The second parameter&mdash;the one <em>without</em> a leading dash&mdash;tells
    <code>ls</code> that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F data</span>
<span class="out">amino_acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The output shows us that there are four text files and two sub-sub-directories.
    Organizing things hierarchically in this way
    is a good way to keep track of our work:
    it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
    just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
    but in the long run it's a self-defeating strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice,
    by the way
    that we spelled the directory name <code>data</code>.
    It doesn't have a trailing slash:
    that's added to directory names by <code>ls</code>
    when we use the <code>-F</code> flag
    to help us tell things apart.
    And it doesn't begin with a slash
    because it's a <a href="glossary.html#relative-path">relative path</a>,
    i.e., it tells <code>ls</code> how to find something from where we are,
    rather than from the root of the file system
    (<a href="#f:relative_path">Figure 7</a>).
  </p>

  <figure id="f:relative_path">
    <img src="{{page.root}}/img/lessons/swc-shell/absolute_relative_path.png" alt="Absolute and Relative Paths" />
    <figcaption>Figure 7: Absolute and Relative Paths</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    If we run <code>ls -F /data</code>
    (<em>with</em> a leading slash)
    we get a different answer,
    because <code>/data</code> is an <a href="glossary.html#absolute-path">absolute path</a>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F /data</span>
<span class="out">access.log    backup/    hardware.cfg
network.cfg</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The leading <code>/</code> tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the filesystem,
    so it always refers to exactly one directory,
    no matter where we are when we run the command.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if we want to change our current working directory?
    Before we do this,
    <code>pwd</code> shows us that we're in <code>/users/vlad</code>,
    and <code>ls</code> without any parameters shows us that directory's contents:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    We can use <code>cd</code> followed by a directory name to change our working directory.
    <code>cd</code> stands for "change directory",
    which is a bit misleading:
    the command doesn't change the directory,
    it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd data</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>cd</code> doesn't print anything,
    but if we run <code>pwd</code> after it,
    we can see that we are now in <code>/users/vlad/data</code>.
    If we run <code>ls</code> without parameters now,
    it lists the contents of <code>/users/vlad/data</code>,
    because that's where we now are:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/data</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">amino_acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      OK, we can go down the directory tree: how do we go up?
      We could use an absolute path:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd /users/vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    but it's almost always simpler to use <code>cd&nbsp;..</code>
    to go up one level:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/data</span>
$ <span class="in">cd ..</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>..</code> is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this one",
    or,
    more succinctly,
    the <a href="glossary.html#parent-directory">parent</a> of the current directory.
  </p>
  
  <div class="box">
    <h3>No Output = OK</h3>

    <p>
      In general, shell programs do not output anything
      if no errors occurred. The principle behind this is
      "If there is nothing to report, shut up.", i. e. if
      there is output, either you specifically requested the
      program to do so or something bad happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not apply to programs like <code>ls</code> or 
      <code>pwd</code>, since the purpose of such programs is
      to output something.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p class="continue">
    Sure enough,
    if we run <code>pwd</code> after running <code>cd&nbsp;..</code>,
    we're back in <code>/users/vlad</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    The special directory <code>..</code> doesn't usually show up when we run <code>ls</code>.
    If we want to display it,
    we can give <code>ls</code> the <code>-a</code> flag:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F -a</span>
<span class="out">./           ../       bin/       data/
mail/        music/    notes.txt  papers/
pizza.cfg    solar/    solar.pdf  swc/</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue" id="a:dot-directory">
    <code>-a</code> stands for "show all";
    it forces <code>ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin with <code>.</code>,
    such as <code>..</code>
    (which, if we're in <code>/users/vlad</code>, refers to the <code>/users</code> directory).
    As you can see,
    it also displays another special directory that's just called <code>.</code>,
    which means "the current working directory".
    It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
    but we'll see some uses for it <a href="#a:move-to-here">soon</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Orthogonality</h3>

    <p>
      The special names <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> don't belong to <code>ls</code>;
      they are interpreted the same way by every program.
      For example,
      if we are in <code>/users/vlad/data</code>,
      the command <code>ls&nbsp;..</code>
      will give us a listing of <code>/users/vlad</code>.
      Programmers call this <a href="glossary.html#orthogonality">orthogonality</a>:
      the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined.
      Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn
      because there are fewer special cases and exceptions to keep track of.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Everything we have seen so far works on Unix and its descendents,
    such as Linux and Mac OS X.
    Things are a bit different on Windows.
    A typical directory path on a Windows 7 machine might be <code>C:\Users\vlad</code>.
    The first part, <code>C:</code>, is a <a href="glossary.html#drive-letter">drive letter</a>
    that identifies which disk we're talking about.
    This notation dates back to the days of floppy drives;
    today,
    different "drives" are usually different filesystems on the network.
  </p>

  <p id="a:space-in-filename">
    Instead of a forward slash,
    Windows uses a backslash to separate the names in a path.
    This causes headaches because Unix uses backslash for input of special characters.
    For example,
    if we want to put a space in a filename on Unix,
    we would write the filename as <code>my\&nbsp;results.txt</code>.
    Please don't ever do this, though:
    if you put spaces,
    question marks,
    and other special characters in filenames on Unix,
    you can confuse the shell for reasons that we'll see shortly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally,
    Windows filenames and directory names are <a href="glossary.html#case-insensitive">case insensitive</a>:
    upper and lower case letters mean the same thing.
    This means that the path name <code>C:\Users\vlad</code> could be spelled
    <code>c:\users\VLAD</code>,
    <code>C:\Users\Vlad</code>,
    and so on.
    Some people argue that this is more natural:
    after all, "VLAD" in all upper case and "Vlad" spelled normally refer to the same person.
    However,
    it causes headaches for programmers,
    and can be difficult for people to understand
    if their first language doesn't use a cased alphabet.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>For Cygwin Users</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.cygwin.org">Cygwin</a> tries to make Windows paths look more like Unix paths
      by allowing us to use a forward slash instead of a backslash as a separator.
      It also allows us to refer to the C drive as <code>/cygdrive/c/</code> instead of as <code>C:</code>.
      (The latter usually works too, but not always.)
      Paths are still case insensitive,
      though,
      which means that if you try to put files called <code>backup.txt</code> (in all lower case)
      and <code>Backup.txt</code> (with a capital 'B') into the same directory,
      the second will overwrite the first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cygwin does something else that frequently causes confusion.
      By default,
      it interprets a path like <code>/home/vlad</code> to mean <code>C:\cygwin\home\vlad</code>,
      i.e.,
      it acts as if <code>C:\cygwin</code> was the root of the filesystem.
      This is sometimes helpful,
      but if you are using an editor like Notepad,
      and want to save a file in what Cygwin thinks of as your home directory,
      you need to keep this translation in mind.

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files</h3>

    <p>
      Knowing just this much about files and directories,
      Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
      First,
      she creates a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre</code>
      (to remind herself where the data came from).
      Inside that, she creates a directory called <code>2012-07-03</code>,
      which is the date she started processing the samples.
      She used to use names like <code>conference-paper</code> and <code>revised-results</code>,
      but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
      (The final straw was when she found herself creating a directory called
      <code>revised-revised-results-3</code>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of her physical samples is labelled
      according to her lab's convention
      with a unique ten-character ID,
      such as "NENE01729A".
      This is what she used in her collection log to record the location,
      time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
      so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
      Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
      she will call her files <code>NENE01729A.txt</code>,
      <code>NENE01812A.txt</code>,
      and so on.
      All 1520 files will go into the same directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      If she is in her home directory,
      Nelle can see what files she has using the command:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      Since this is a lot to type,
      she can take advantage of Bash's
      <a href="glossary.html#command-completion">command completion</a>.
      If she types:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls no</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and then presses <span class="in">tab</span>,
      Bash will automatically complete the directory name for her:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls north-pacific-gyre/</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      If she presses tab again,
      Bash will add <code>2012-07-03/</code> to the command,
      since it's the only possible completion.
      Pressing tab again does nothing,
      since there are 1520 possibilities;
      pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,
      and so on.
      This is called <a id="a:tab-completion" href="glossary.html#tab-completion">tab completion</a>,
      and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

<div id="s:shell:create:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    We now know how to explore files and directories,
    but how do we create them in the first place?
    Let's go back to Vlad's home directory,
    <code>/users/vlad</code>,
    and use <code>ls -F</code> to see what it contains:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Let's create a new directory called <code>thesis</code>
    using the command <code>mkdir thesis</code>
    (which has no output):
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">mkdir thesis</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    As you might (or might not) guess from its name,
    <code>mkdir</code> means "make directory".
    Since <code>thesis</code> is a relative path
    (i.e., doesn't have a leading slash),
    the new directory is made below the current one:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/      <span class="highlight">thesis/</span></span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    However, there's nothing in it yet:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F thesis</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Let's change our working directory to <code>thesis</code> using <code>cd</code>,
    then run an editor called Nano
    to create a file called <code>nano draft.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">nano draft.txt</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Nano is a very simple text editor that only a programmer could really love.
    <a href="#f:nano">Figure 9</a> shows what it looks like when it runs:
    the cursor is the blinking square in the upper left,
    and the two lines across the bottom show us the available commands.
    (By convention,
    Unix documentation uses the caret <code>^</code> followed by a letter
    to mean "control plus that letter",
    so <code>^O</code> means <span class="keyboard">Control+O</span>.)

    then use <span class="in">Control-O</span> to write our data to disk.

    we can use <span class="in">Control-X</span> to quit the editor and return to the shell.

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Which Editor?</h3>

    <p>
      When we say, "<code>nano</code> is a text editor,"
      we really do mean "text":
      it can only work with plain character data,
      not tables,
      images,
      or any other human-friendly media.
      We use it in examples because
      almost anyone can drive it anywhere without training,
      but please use something more powerful for real work.
      On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS&nbsp;X),
      many programmers use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
      or <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
      (both of which are completely unintuitive, even by Unix standards),
      or a graphical editor such as <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">Gedit</a>.
      On Windows,
      you may wish to use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter what editor you use,
      you will need to know where it searches for and saves files.
      If you start it from the shell,
      it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location.
      If you use your computer's start menu,
      it may want to save files in your desktop or documents directory instead.
      You can change this by navigating to another directory
      the first time you "Save As..."
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    <code>nano</code> doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits.
    But <code>ls</code> now shows that we have created a file called <code>draft.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">draft.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    If we just want to quickly create a file with no content, we
    can use the command <code>touch</code>.
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch draft_empty.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">draft.txt   draft_empty.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    The <code>touch</code> command has allowed us to create a file
    without leaving the command line.  As with text editors like 
    <code>nano</code>, <code>touch</code> will create the file in
    your current working directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we <code>touch</code> a file that already exists, the time of
    last modification for the file is updated to the present time,
    but the file is otherwise unaltered.  We can demonstrate this by
    running <code>ls</code> with the <code>-l</code> flag to give a
    long listing of files in the
    current directory which includes information about the date and

</pre>

  <p>
    Note how the modification time of <code>draft.txt</code> changes
    after we <code>touch</code> it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can run <code>ls</code> with the <code>-s</code> flag
    (for "size")
    to show us how large <code>draft.txt</code> is:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -s</span>
<span class="out">   1  draft.txt        0  draft_empty.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Unfortunately,
    Unix reports sizes in <a href="glossary.html#disk-block">disk blocks</a> by default,
    which might be the least helpful default imaginable.
    If we add the <code>-h</code> flag,
    <code>ls</code> switches to more human-friendly units:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -s -h</span>
<span class="out"> 512  draft.txt        0  draft_empty.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Here, 512 is the number of bytes in the <code>draft.txt</code> file.
    This is more than we actually typed in because
    the smallest unit of storage on the disk is typically a block of 512 bytes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start tidying up by running <code>rm draft.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">rm draft.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This command removes files ("rm" is short for "remove").
    If we run <code>ls</code>, only the <code>draft_empty.txt</code>
    file remains:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">draft_empty.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Now we'll finish cleaning up by running <code>rm draft_empty.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">rm draft_empty.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    If we run <code>ls</code> again, its output is empty,
    which tells us that both of our files are gone:

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
$
</pre>

    <h3>Deleting Is Forever</h3>

    <p>
      Unix doesn't have a trash bin:
      when we delete files,
      they are unhooked from the file system
      so that their storage space on disk can be recycled.
      Tools for finding and recovering deleted files do exist,
      but there's no guarantee they'll work in any particular situation,
      since the computer may recycle the file's disk space right away.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Let's re-create <code>draft.txt</code> as an empty file,
    and then move up one directory to <code>/users/vlad</code> using <code>cd&nbsp;..</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">touch draft.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">draft.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cd ..</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    If we try to remove the entire <code>thesis</code> directory using <code>rm thesis</code>,
    we get an error message:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">rm thesis</span>
<span class="err">rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This happens because <code>rm</code> only works on files, not directories.
    The right command is <code>rmdir</code>, which is short for "remove directory":
    It doesn't work yet either, though,
    because the directory we're trying to remove isn't empty:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">rmdir thesis</span>
<span class="err">rmdir: failed to remove `thesis': Directory not empty</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This little safety feature can save you a lot of grief,
    particularly if you are a bad typist.
    If we really want to get rid of <code>thesis</code>
    we should first delete the file <code>draft.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">rm thesis/draft.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The directory is now empty,
    so <code>rmdir</code> can delete it:

<pre>
$ <span class="in">rmdir thesis</span>
$

    <h3>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</h3>

    <p>
      Removing the files in a directory
      just so that we can remove the directory
      quickly becomes tedious.
      Instead,
      we can use <code>rm</code> with the <code>-r</code> flag
      (which stands for "recursive"):
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">rm -r thesis</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      This removes everything in the directory,
      then the directory itself.
      If the directory contains sub-directories,
      <code>rm&nbsp;-r</code> does the same thing to them,
      and so on.
      It's very handy,
      but can do a lot of damage if used without care.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Let's create that directory and file one more time.
    (Note that this time we're running <code>touch</code> with the path <code>thesis/draft.txt</code>,
    rather than going into the <code>thesis</code> directory
    and running <code>touch</code> on <code>draft.txt</code> there.)
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">mkdir thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">touch thesis/draft.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls thesis</span>
<span class="out">draft.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>draft.txt</code> isn't a particularly informative name,
    so let's change the file's name using <code>mv</code>,
    which is short for "move":
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The first parameter tells <code>mv</code> what we're "moving",
    while the second is where it's to go.
    In this case,
    we're moving <code>thesis/draft.txt</code> to <code>thesis/quotes.txt</code>,
    which has the same effect as renaming the file.
    Sure enough,
    <code>ls</code> shows us that <code>thesis</code> now contains one file called <code>quotes.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls thesis</span>
<span class="out">quotes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Just for the sake of inconsistency,
    <code>mv</code> also works on directories&mdash;there
    is no separate <code>mvdir</code> command.
  </p>

  <p id="a:move-to-here">
    Let's move <code>quotes.txt</code> into the current working directory.
    We use <code>mv</code> once again,
    but this time
    we'll just use the name of a directory as the second parameter
    to tell <code>mv</code> that we want to keep the filename,
    but put the file somewhere new.
    (This is why the command is called "move".)
    In this case,
    the directory name we use is
    the special directory name <code>.</code> that we <a href="#a:dot-directory">mentioned earlier</a>):
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">mv thesis/quotes.txt .</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in
    to the current directory.
    <code>ls</code> now shows us that <code>thesis</code> is empty,
    and that <code>quotes.txt</code> is in our current directory:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls thesis</span>
$ <span class="in">ls quotes.txt</span>
<span class="out">quotes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    (Notice that <code>ls</code> with a filename or directory name as an parameter
    only lists that file or directory.)
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>cp</code> command works very much like <code>mv</code>,
    except it copies a file instead of moving it.
    We can check that it did the right thing
    using <code>ls</code> with two paths as parameters&mdash;like most Unix commands,
    <code>ls</code> can be given thousands of paths at once:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt</span>
<span class="out">quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    To prove that we made a copy,
    let's delete the <code>quotes.txt</code> file in the current directory,
    and then run that same <code>ls</code> again.
    This time,
    it tells us that it can't find <code>quotes.txt</code> in the current directory,
    but it does find the copy in <code>thesis</code> that we didn't delete:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt</span>
<span class="err">ls: cannot access quotes.txt: No such file or directory</span>
<span class="out">thesis/quotations.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Another Useful Abbreviation</h3>

    <p>
      The shell interprets the character <code>~</code> (tilde) at the start of a path
      to mean "the current user's home directory".
      For example,
      if Vlad's home directory is <code>/home/vlad</code>,
      then <code>~/data</code> is equivalent to <code>/home/vlad/data</code>.
      This only works if it is the first character in the path:
      <code>/~</code> is <em>not</em> the user's home directory,
      and <code>here/there/~/elsewhere</code> is <em>not</em> <code>/home/vlad/elsewhere</code>.

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

<div id="s:shell:wildcard:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    At this point we have a basic toolkit which allows us to do
    things in the shell that you can normally do in Windows,
    Mac OS, or GNU/Linux with your mouse.  For example, 
    we can create, delete
    and move individual files.  We will now learn about
    <a href="glossary.html#wildcard">wildcards</a>,
    which will allow us to expand our toolkit so that we can
    perform operations on multiple files with a single command.
    We'll start in an empty directory and create four files:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch file1.txt file2.txt otherfile1.txt otherfile2.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">file1.txt   file2.txt   otherfile1.txt   otherfile2.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    If we want to see all filenames that start with "file", we can run the
    command <code>ls file*</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file*</span>
<span class="out">file1.txt   file2.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <div class="box" id="a:asterisk">
    <h3>Asterisk (*) Wildcard</h3>
    <p>
      The asterisk wildcard <code>*</code> in the expression 
      <code>file*</code> matches zero
      or more characters of any kind.  Thus the expression <code>file*</code>
      matches anything that starts with "file".  On the other hand,
      <code>*file*</code> would match anything containing the word "file"
      at all, such as <code>file1.txt</code>, 
      <code>file2.txt</code>, <code>otherfile1.txt</code>, and
      <code>otherfile2.txt</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands it to create a list of
      matching filenames <em>before</em> passing those names to whatever
      command is being run.  This means that when you execute
      <code>ls file*</code>, the shell first expands it to 
      <code>ls file1.txt file2.txt</code> in the above example, 
      and then runs that command.  This process of expansion is
      called <a href="glossary.html#glob">globbing</a>.
      Therefore commands like <code>ls</code> and
      <code>rm</code> never see the wildcard characters, just what
      those wildcards matched.  This is another example of orthogonal
      design.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    There are four other basic wildcard characters we will explore:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <b>question mark, <code>?</code></b>, matches 
      any single character,
      so <code>text?.txt</code> would match 
      <code>text1.txt</code> or 
      <code>textz.txt</code>,
      but not <code>text_1.txt</code>.</li>
    <li>The <b>square brackets, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code></b>, 
      which can be used to specify a set of possible characters.
      For example, <code>text[135].txt</code> would match 
      <code>text1.txt</code>,
      <code>text3.txt</code>,
      and <code>text5.txt</code>.
      You can also specify a natural sequence of characters using
      a dash.  For example,
      <code>text[1-6].txt</code> would match 
      <code>text1.txt</code>, 
      <code>text2.txt</code>, ...,
      <code>text6.txt</code>.</li>
    <li>The <b>curly braces, <code>{}</code></b>, are similar to the square
      brackets, except that they take a list of items separated by
      commas, and that they always expand all elements of the list,
      whether or not the corresponding filenames exist.
      For example, <code>text{1,5}.txt</code> would expand to
      <code>text1.txt text5.txt</code> whether or not
      <code>text1.txt</code> and <code>text5.txt</code> actually
      exist.
      The elements of the list need not be single characters, so
      <code>text{12,5}.txt</code> expands to
      <code>text12.txt text5.txt</code>.
      Natural sequences can be specified using <code>..</code>, i.e.
      <code>text{1..5}.txt</code> would expand to
      <code>text1.txt text2.txt text3.txt text4.txt text5.txt</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We can use any number of wildcards at a time:
    for example,
    <code>p*.p?*</code> matches anything that starts with a 'p'
    and ends with '.', 'p', and at least one more character
    (since the '?' has to match one character,
    and the final '*' can match any number of characters).
    Thus,
    <code>p*.p?*</code> would match
    <code>preferred.practice</code>,
    and even <code>p.pi</code>
    (since the first '*' can match no characters at all),
    but not <code>quality.practice</code> (doesn't start with 'p')
    or <code>preferred.p</code> (there isn't at least one character after the '.p').
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let's see some more examples of wildcards in action.  First we will
    remove everything in the current directory:
  </p>
  
<pre>
$ <span class="in">rm *</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Now that our working directory is empty, let's create some
    empty files using the touch command and the curly braces:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch file{4,6,7}.txt file_{a..e}.txt</span>
$ 
</pre>

  <p>
    The curly braces expand the second token <code>file{4,6,7}.txt</code>
    into three
    separate file names, and the third token <code>file_{a..e}.txt</code>
    expands into five separate
    file names.  So, now if we list files using the asterisk wildcard,
    we get:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file*</span>
<span class="out">file4.txt   file7.txt    file_b.txt   file_d.txt</span>
<span class="out">file6.txt   file_a.txt   file_c.txt   file_e.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    We have matched all files in our current directory that begin
    with <code>file</code>.  Now, let us list a subset of those files using
    the question mark:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file?.txt</span>
<span class="out">file4.txt   file6.txt    file7.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Note how this glob pattern matched only the numbered files.  That's
    because only the numbered files have a single character
    between <code>file</code> and <code>.txt</code>.  The lettered files
    have two characters between <code>file</code> and <code>.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file??.txt</span>
<span class="out">file_a.txt   file_b.txt    file_c.txt   file_d.txt   file_e.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    It's also possible to combine and nest wildcards.  For example, 
    <code>file{4,_?}.txt</code> would match <code>file4.txt</code> 
    and <code>file_?.txt</code>, where <code>?</code> matches any 
    single character. To demonstrate this, let's re-create all of 
    our files:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch file{4,6,7}.txt file_{a..e}.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">file4.txt   file7.txt    file_b.txt   file_d.txt</span>
<span class="out">file6.txt   file_a.txt   file_c.txt   file_e.txt</span>
$ 
</pre>

  <p>
    Now let's run <code>ls file{4,_?}.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file{4,_?}.txt</span>
<span class="out">file4.txt   file_b.txt   file_d.txt</span>
<span class="out">file_a.txt   file_c.txt   file_e.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Finally, it is important to understand what happens if a 
    wildcard expression doesn't match any files.  In this case, 
    the wildcard characters are interpreted literally.  For 
    example, if we were to enter <code>ls file[AB].txt</code>,
    the system will first try to find <code>fileA.txt</code> or
    <code>fileB.txt</code>.  If it found either of those, then
    the wildcard expression would be expanded appropriately, 
    but when it fails to find either of
    them, the expression remains unevaluated as
    <code>file[AB].txt</code>, and is then passed to <code>ls</code>.
    At this point,
    <code>ls</code> will try to find a single file that is
    actually named <code>file[AB].txt</code>.
    We can see that this is the case if we try
    <code>ls file[AB].txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file[AB].txt</span>
<span class="out">ls: file[AB].txt: No such file or directory</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    The system tells us that <code>file[AB].txt</code> doesn't exist
    since this was the file it was looking for after the wildcard
    expression found no matches.  Still not
    convinced?  Let's actually create a file named <code>file[AB].txt</code>.
    To do this, we need some way of telling the computer that we
    actually want the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> characters to be in the filename, and
    that we don't mean them as wildcards.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Escaping Special Characters</h3>

    <p>
      Wildcard characters, like <code>*</code>, <code>[]</code>,
      and <code>{}</code> are all special characters in bash.  
      Another example of a special character which we have already
      encountered, and that is <em>not</em>
      a wildcard character, is the forward slash <code>/</code>,
      which is used to delimit directory levels.  It is possible to
      <em>escape</em> special characters, i.e. turn off their
      special meanings.
      We can escape a single character by preceding it with a
      backslash, <code>\</code>.  This tells the shell to interpret
      that character literally.
      For example, writing <code>\/</code>
      tells bash to interpret the forward slash literally. We can escape
      more than one character by enclosing a set of characters in
      either single or double quotes. Single quotes preserve the
      literal value of each character enclosed.  Double quotes
      preserve the literal value of each character enclosed with the
      exception of <code>$</code>, <code>`</code>, and
      <code>\</code>, which all retain their special meanings. 
      Therefore, inside double quotes, 
      backslashes <code>\</code> preceding any of these three special
      characters will be removed.  Otherwise, the backslash will remain.
      For the example above of creating a file named
      <code>file[AB].txt</code>, one can do any of the following:
      <code>touch "file[AB].txt"</code>,
      <code>touch 'file[AB].txt'</code>, 
      <code>touch file\[AB\].txt</code>, or
      <code>touch "file\[AB\].txt"</code>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Now we can create the file <code>file[AB].txt</code>:
  </p>
  
<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch "file[AB].txt"</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">file4.txt   file7.txt      file_a.txt   file_c.txt   file_e.txt</span>
<span class="out">file6.txt   file[AB].txt   file_b.txt   file_d.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    If we do <code>ls file[AB].txt</code>, it will find the
    file we've just created:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file[AB].txt</span>
<span class="out">file[AB].txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    But if we create a file named <code>fileA.txt</code>,
    this will be found first by the wildcard expansion,
    since it first looks for <code>fileA.txt</code> and
    <code>fileB.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch fileA.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">ls file[AB].txt</span>
<span class="out">fileA.txt</span>
$
</pre>
    
  <p>
    If we really do want to look for something called
    <code>file[AB].txt</code>, and not <code>fileA.txt</code>
    or <code>fileB.txt</code>, then we have to escape the special
    characters "[" and "]".  We can do this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls file\[AB\].txt</span>
<span class="out">file[AB].txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    or this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls "file[AB].txt"</span>
<span class="out">file[AB].txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Single quotes would work as well in this case.

<p>
  In the lesson we started in an empty directory and created 
  several files using the command:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch file{4,6,7}.txt file{a..e}.txt</span>
$
</pre>

<p>
  What files, if any, would have been created if we had instead
  used square brackets?  I.e.
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch file[467].txt file[a-e].txt</span>
$
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
<p>
  We also discussed the effect of running
  <code>ls file[AB].txt</code> when neither the file
  <code>fileA.txt</code>, nor the file <code>fileB.txt</code>,
  nor the file <code>file[AB].txt</code> existed.
  What would be the effect of running
  <code>ls file{A,B}.txt</code> under these
  circumstances?
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
<p>
  Recall the discussion of escaping characters using
  single quotes, double quotes, and the backslash.

<p>
  What would the output of <code>ls</code> be if we issued the following bash commands?

<p>
  How can we create the same files as in the previous problem 
  without any quotes?  Hint: This
  requires some careful thought about how to apply the backslash

  output files if they were used instead of double quotes
  in the previous problem?

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

<div id="s:shell:pipefilter:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    Now that we know a few basic commands and have learned how
    to use wildcards,
    we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature:
    the ease with which it lets you combine existing programs in new ways.
    We'll start with a directory called <code>molecules</code>
    that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.
    The <code>.pdb</code> extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format,
    a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls molecules</span>
<span class="out">cubane.pdb    ethane.pdb    methane.pdb
octane.pdb    pentane.pdb   propane.pdb</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Let's go into that directory with <code>cd</code>
    and run the command <code>wc&nbsp;*.pdb</code>.
    <code>wc</code> is the "word count" command;
    it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd molecules</span>
$ <span class="in">wc *.pdb</span>
<span class="out">  20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
  12   84  622 ethane.pdb
   9   57  422 methane.pdb
  30  246 1828 octane.pdb
  21  165 1226 pentane.pdb
  15  111  825 propane.pdb
 107  819 6081 total</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    If we run <code>wc -l</code> instead of just <code>wc</code>,
    the output shows only the number of lines per file:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l *.pdb</span>
<span class="out">  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    We can also use <code>-w</code> to get only the number of words,
    or <code>-c</code> to get only the number of characters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, which of these files is shortest?
    It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files, but what if there were 6000?
    That's the kind of job we want a computer to do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The <code>&gt;</code> tells the shell to <a href="glossary.html#redirection">redirect</a>
    the command's output to a file
    instead of printing it to the screen.
    The shell will create the file if it doesn't exist,
    or overwrite the contents of that file if it does.
    (This is why there is no screen output:
    everything that <code>wc</code> would have printed has gone into the file <code>lengths</code> instead.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>ls lengths</code> confirms that the file exists:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls lengths</span>
<span class="out">lengths</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    We can now send the content of <code>lengths</code> to the screen using <code>cat lengths</code>.
    <code>cat</code> stands for "concatenate":
    it prints the contents of files one after another.
    In this case,
    there's only one file,
    so <code>cat</code> just shows us what it contains:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cat lengths</span>
<span class="out">  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Now let's use the <code>sort</code> command to sort its contents.
    This does <em>not</em> change the file.
    Instead,
    it sends the sorted result to the screen:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">sort lengths</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb
 12  ethane.pdb
 15  propane.pdb
 20  cubane.pdb
 21  pentane.pdb
 30  octane.pdb
107  total</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called <code>sorted-lengths</code>
    by putting <code>&gt;&nbsp;sorted-lengths</code> after the command,
    just as we used <code>&gt;&nbsp;lengths</code> to put the output of <code>wc</code> into <code>lengths</code>.
    Once we've done that,
    we can run another command called <code>head</code> to get the first few lines in <code>sorted-lengths</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">sort lengths &gt; sorted-lengths</span>
$ <span class="in">head -1 sorted-lengths</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Giving <code>head</code> the parameter <code>-1</code> tells us we only want the first line of the file;
    <code>-20</code> would get the first 20, and so on.
    Since <code>sorted-lengths</code> the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,
    the output of <code>head</code> must be the file with the fewest lines.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you think this is confusing, you're in good company:
    even once you understand what <code>wc</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>head</code> do,
    all those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.
    How can we make it easier to understand?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start by getting rid of the <code>sorted-lengths</code> file
    by running <code>sort</code> and <code>head</code> together:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">sort lengths | head -1</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The vertical bar between the two commands
    is called a <a href="glossary.html#pipe">pipe</a>.
    It tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left
    as the input to the command on the right.
    The computer might create a temporary file if it needs to,
    or copy data from one program to the other in memory,
    or something else entirely:
    we don't have to know or care.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, if we don't need to create the temporary file <code>sorted-lengths</code>,
    can we get rid of the <code>lengths</code> file too?
    The answer is "yes":
    we can use another pipe to send the output of <code>wc</code> directly to <code>sort</code>,
    which then sends its output to <code>head</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l *.pdb | sort | head -1</span>
<span class="out">  9  methane.pdb</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like <em>sin(&pi;x)<sup>2</sup></em>
    and saying "the square of the sine of <em>x</em> times &pi;":
    in our case, the calculation is "head of sort of word count of <code>*.pdb</code>".
  </p>

  <div class="box" id="b:pipefilter:pipes">
    <h3>Inside Pipes</h3>

    <p>
      Here's what actually happens behind the scenes when we create a pipe.
      When a computer runs a program&mdash;any program&mdash;it
      creates a <a href="glossary.html#process">process</a> in memory
      to hold the program's software and its current state.
      Every process has an input channel called <a href="glossary.html#standard-input">standard input</a>.
      (By this point, you may be surprised that the name is so memorable, but don't worry:
      most Unix programmers call it <a href="glossary.html#stdin">stdin</a>.)
      Every process also has a default output channel called <a href="glossary.html#standard-output">standard output</a>,
      or <a href="glossary.html#stdout">stdout</a>
      (<a href="#f:process_stdin_stdout">Figure 11</a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="f:process_stdin_stdout">
      <img src="{{page.root}}/img/lessons/swc-shell/process_stdin_stdout.png" alt="A Process with Standard Input and Output" />
      <figcaption>Figure 11: A Process with Standard Input and Output</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The shell is just another program, and runs in a process like any other.
      Under normal circumstances,
      whatever we type on the keyboard is sent to the shell on its standard input,
      and whatever it produces on standard output is displayed on our screen
      (<a href="#f:shell_as_process">Figure 12</a>):
    </p>

    <figure id="f:shell_as_process">

      <figcaption>Figure 12: The Shell as a Process</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      When we run a program,
      the shell creates a new process.
      It then temporarily sends whatever we type on our keyboard to that process's standard input,
      and whatever the process sends to standard output to the screen
      (<a href="#f:running_a_process">Figure 13</a>):
    </p>

    <figure id="f:running_a_process">
      <img src="{{page.root}}/img/lessons/swc-shell/running_a_process.png" alt="Running a Process" />
      <figcaption>Figure 13: Running a Process</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Here's what happens when we run <code>wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths</code>.
      The shell starts by telling the computer to create a new process to run the <code>wc</code> program.
      Since we've provided some filenames as parameters,
      <code>wc</code> reads from them instead of from standard input.
      And since we've used <code>&gt;</code> to redirect output to a file,
      the shell connects the process's standard output to that file
      (<a href="#f:running_wc">Figure 14</a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="f:running_wc">
      <img src="{{page.root}}/img/lessons/swc-shell/running_wc.png" alt="Running One Program with Redirection" />
      <figcaption>Figure 14: Running One Program with Redirection</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      If we run <code>wc -l *.pdb | sort</code> instead,
      the shell creates two processes,
      one for each process in the pipe,
      so that <code>wc</code> and <code>sort</code> run simultaneously.
      The standard output of <code>wc</code> is fed directly to the standard input of <code>sort</code>;
      since there's no redirection with <code>&gt;</code>, <code>sort</code>'s output goes to the screen
      (<a href="#f:running_wc_sort">Figure 15</a>):
    </p>

      <figcaption>Figure 15: Running Two Programs in a Pipe</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="continue">
      And if we run <code>wc -l *.pdb | sort | head -1</code>,
      we get the three processes shown in <a href="#f:running_wc_sort_head">Figure 16</a>
      with data flowing from the files,
      through <code>wc</code> to <code>sort</code>,
      and from <code>sort</code> through <code>head</code> to the screen.

  </div>

  <p>
    This simple idea is why Unix has been so successful.
    Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things,
    Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well,
    and work well with each other.
    Ten such tools can be combined in 100 ways, and that's only looking at pairings:
    when we start to look at pipes with multiple stages,
    the possibilities are almost uncountable.
  </p>

  <p>
    This programming model is called <a href="glossary.html#pipe-and-filter">pipes and filters</a>.
    We've already seen pipes;
    a <a href="glossary.html#filter">filter</a> is
    a program that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.
    Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way:
    unless told to do otherwise,
    they read from standard input,
    do something with what they've read,
    and write to standard output.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input,
    and writes lines of text to standard output,
    can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.
    You can <em>and should</em> write your programs this way,
    so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.
  </p>
  
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Redirecting Input</h3>

    <p>
      As well as using <code>&gt;</code> to redirect a program's output,
      we can use <code>&lt;</code> to redirect its input,
      i.e.,
      to read from a file instead of from standard input.
      For example, instead of writing <code>wc ammonia.pdb</code>,
      we could write <code>wc &lt; ammonia.pdb</code>.
      In the first case,
      <code>wc</code> gets a command line parameter telling it what file to open.
      In the second,
      <code>wc</code> doesn't have any command line parameters,
      so it reads from standard input,
      but we have told the shell to send the contents of <code>ammonia.pdb</code> to <code>wc</code>'s standard input.
    </p>

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Checking Files</h3>

    <p>
      Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines
      and created 1520 files in the <code>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code> directory
      described <a href="#a:organizing-files">earlier</a>.
      As a quick sanity check,
      she types:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</span>
$ <span class="in">wc -l *.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      The output is 1520 lines that look like this:
    </p>

<pre>
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt
 300 NENE01751B.txt
 300 NENE01812A.txt
 ... ...
</pre>

    <p>
      Now she types this:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l *.txt | sort | head -5</span>
 240 NENE02018B.txt
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      Whoops:
      one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.
      When she goes back and checks it,
      she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning&mdash;someone
      was probably in using the machine on the weekend,
      and she forgot to reset it.
      Before re-running that sample,
      she checks to see if any files have too much data:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l *.txt | sort | <span class="highlight">tail</span> -5</span>
 300 NENE02040A.txt
 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt
</pre>

    <p>
      Those numbers look good&mdash;but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line?
      All of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B';
      by convention,
      her lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information.
      To find others like it,
      she does this:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls *Z.txt</span>
NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      Sure enough,
      when she checks the log on her laptop,
      there's no depth recorded for either of those samples.
      Since it's too late to get the information any other way,
      she must exclude those two files from her analysis.
      She could just delete them using <code>rm</code>,
      but there are actually some analyses she might do later
      where depth doesn't matter,
      so instead,
      she'll just be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expression
      <code>*[AB].txt</code>.
      As always, the '*' matches any number of characters,
      and recall from the previous section that <code>[AB]</code>
      matches either an 'A' or a 'B',
      so this matches all the valid data files she has.

  The command <code>uniq</code> removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input.
  For example,
  if a file <code>salmon.txt</code> contains:
</p>

<pre>
coho
coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
steelhead
</pre>

<p>
  then <code>uniq salmon.txt</code> produces:
</p>

<pre>
coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
</pre>

<p>
  Why do you think <code>uniq</code> only removes <em>adjacent</em> duplicated lines?
  (Hint: think about very large data sets.)
  What other command could you combine with it in a pipe

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

<div id="s:shell:loop:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    Wildcards and tabs are one way to save on typing.
    Another is to tell the shell to do something over and over again.
    Suppose we have several hundred genome data files in a directory
    with names like <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    <code>unicorn.dat</code>,
    and so on.
    When new files arrive,
    we'd like to rename the existing ones to
    <code>original-basilisk.dat</code>,
    <code>original-unicorn.dat</code>,
    etc.
    We can't use:
  </p>

<pre>
mv *.dat original-*.dat
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    because that would expand (in the two-file case) to:
  </p>

<pre>
mv basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This wouldn't back up our files:
    it would replace the content of <code>unicorn.dat</code>
    with whatever's in <code>basilisk.dat</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead,
    we can use a <a href="glossary.html#for-loop">loop</a>
    to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
    Here's a simple example
    that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat</span>
&gt; <span class="in">do</span>
&gt;    <span class="in">head -3 $filename</span>
&gt; <span class="in">done</span>
<span class="out">COMMON NAME: basilisk
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
UPDATED: 1745-05-02
COMMON NAME: unicorn
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
UPDATED: 1738-11-24</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>,
    it knows it is supposed to repeat a command (or group of commands)
    once for each thing in a list.
    In this case,
    the list is the two filenames.
    Each time through the loop,
    the name of the thing currently being operated on
    is assigned to the <a href="glossary.html#variable">variable</a> <code>filename</code>.
    Inside the loop,
    we get the variable's value by putting <code>$</code> in front of it
    (this is known as shell parameter expansion),
    so the first time through the loop,
    <code>$filename</code> is <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    and the second time,
    <code>unicorn.dat</code>.
    Finally,
    the command that's actually being run is our old friend <code>head</code>,
    so this loop prints out the first three lines of each data file in turn.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Follow the Prompt</h3>

    <p>
      You may have noticed that the shell prompt changed
      from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and back again
      as we were typing in our loop.
      The second prompt, <code>&gt;</code>,
      is different to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>What's In a Name?</h3>

    <p>
      We have called the variable in this loop <code>filename</code>
      in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
      The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called
      (but when we use the variable value it is a good practice to use
      <code>${filename}</code> instead of <code>$filename</code> to avoid
      some types of problems);
      if we wrote this loop as:
    </p>

<pre>
for x in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $x
done
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      or:
    </p>

<pre>
for temperature in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $temperature
done
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      it would work exactly the same way.
      <em>Don't do this.</em>
      Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
      so using meaningless names (like <code>x</code>)
      or misleading names (like <code>temperature</code>)
      increases the likelihood of the program being wrong.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Here's a slightly more complicated loop:
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    echo $filename
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done
</pre>

  <p>
    The shell starts by expanding <code>*.dat</code>
    to create the list of files it will process.
    The <a href="glossary.html#loop-body">loop body</a> then executes two commands
    for each of those files.
    The first,
    <code>echo</code>,
    just prints its command-line parameters to standard output.
    For example:
  </p>

<pre>
echo hello there
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    prints:
  </p>

<pre>
hello there
</pre>

  <p>
    In this case,
    since the shell expands <code>$filename</code> to be the name of a file,
    <code>echo $filename</code> just prints the name of the file.
    Note that we can't write this as:
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    <span class="highlight">$filename</span>
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    because then the first time through the loop,
    when <code>$filename</code> expanded to <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    the shell would try to run <code>basilisk.dat</code> as a program.
    Finally,
    the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> combination
    selects lines 80-100 from whatever file is being processed.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Spaces in Names</h3>

    <p>
      Filename expansion in loops is another reason
      <a href="#a:space-in-filename">you should <em>not</em> use spaces in filenames</a>.
      Suppose our data files are named:
    </p>

<pre>
basilisk.dat
red dragon.dat
unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      If we try to process them using:
    </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    echo $filename
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      then <code>*.dat</code> will expand to:
    </p>

<pre>
basilisk.dat red dragon.dat unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which means that <code>filename</code> will be assigned
      each of the following values in turn:
    </p>

<pre>
basilisk.dat
<span class="highlight">red
dragon.dat</span>
unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p>
      The highlighted lines show the problem:
      instead of getting one name <code>red&nbsp;dragon.dat</code>,
      the commands in the loop will get <code>red</code> and <code>dragon.dat</code> separately.
      To make matters worse,
      the file <code>red&nbsp;dragon.dat</code> won't be processed at all.
      There are ways to get around this, the simplest of which is to put quote marks around <code>"$filename"</code>,
      but the safest thing is to use dashes,
      underscores,
      or some other printable character instead of spaces in your file names.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Going back to our original file renaming problem,
    we can solve it using this loop:
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    mv $filename original-$filename
done
</pre>

  <p>
    This loop runs the <code>mv</code> command once for each filename.
    The first time,
    when <code>$filename</code> expands to <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    the shell executes:
  </p>

<pre>
mv basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The second time,
    the command is:
  </p>

<pre>
mv unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</pre>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Measure Twice, Run Once</h3>

    <p>
      A loop is a way to do many things at once&mdash;or
      to make many mistakes at once
      if it does the wrong thing.
      One way to check what a loop <em>would</em> do is
      to echo the commands it would run
      instead of actually running them.
      For example,
      we could write our file renaming loop like this:
    </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    <span class="highlight">echo</span> mv $filename original-$filename
done
</pre>

    <p>
      Instead of running <code>mv</code>,
      this loop runs <code>echo</code>,
      which prints out:
    </p>

<pre>
mv basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
mv unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      <em>without</em> actually running those commands.
      We can then use up-arrow to redisplay the loop,
      back-arrow to get to the word <code>echo</code>,
      delete it,
      and then press "enter" to run the loop
      with the actual <code>mv</code> commands.
      This isn't foolproof,
      but it's a handy way to see what's going to happen
      when you're still learning how loops work.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
  So far we have been renaming files of the form <code>someanimal.dat</code> to
  <code>original-someanimal.dat</code>. But, what if instead of
  <code>original-someanimal.dat</code> we want
  <code>someanimal.dat.original</code> or <code>someanimal-original.dat</code>?
  For <code>someanimal.dat.original</code> we can do
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    mv $filename $filename.original
done
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
  But for <code>someanimal-original.dat</code> we will need to go a little deeper
  in shell parameter expansion and use its find and replace feature. That syntax
  is <code>${variable/find/substitute/}</code> where <code>find</code> is the
  longest string in <code>variable</code> value that we want to be replaced by
  <code>substitute</code>. We can achieve this task using
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    mv $filename ${filename/.dat/-original.dat/}
done
</pre>

  <div>
    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files</h3>

    <p>
      Nelle is now ready to process her data files.
      Since she's still learning how to use the shell,
      she decides to build up the required commands in stages.
      Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right files&mdash;remember,
      these are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z':
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</span>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt
do
    echo $datafile
done</span>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      Her next step is to figure out what to call the files
      that the <code>goostat</code> analysis program will create.
      Prefixing each input file's name with "stats" seems simple,
      so she modifies her loop to do that:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt
do
    echo $datafile stats-$datafile
done</span>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt stats-NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      She hasn't actually run <code>goostats</code> yet,
      but now she's sure she can select the right files
      and generate the right output filenames.
    </p>

    <p id="a:repeat">
      Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
      though,
      and Nelle is worried about making mistakes,
      so instead of re-entering her loop,
      she presses the up arrow.
      In response,
      Bash redisplays the whole loop on one line
      (using semi-colons to separate the pieces):
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      Using the left arrow key,
      Nelle backs up and changes the command <code>echo</code> to <code>goostats</code>:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do <span class="highlight">goostats</span> $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      When she presses enter,
      Bash runs the modified command.
      However,
      nothing appears to happen&mdash;there is no output.
      After a moment,
      Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer,
      she has no idea whether it is running,
      much less how quickly.
      She kills the job by typing Control-C,
      uses up-arrow to repeat the command,
      and edits it to read:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do <span class="highlight">echo $datafile;</span> goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      When she runs her program now,
      it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...</span>
$
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      1518 times 5 seconds, divided by 60,
      tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.
      As a final check,
      she opens another terminal window,
      goes into <code>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code>,
      and uses <code>cat NENE01729B.txt</code> to examine
      one of the output files.
      It looks good,
      so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It</h3>

      <p>
        Another way to repeat previous work is to use the <code>history</code> command
        to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed,
        and then to use <code>!123</code> (where "123" is replaced by the command number)
        to repeat one of those commands.
        For example,
        if Nelle types this:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">$ history | tail -5</span>
<span class="out">  456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt
  458  goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
  459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  460  history</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        then she can re-run <code>goostats</code> on <code>NENE01729B.txt</code>
        simply by typing <code>!458</code>.
      </p>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>

<div id="s:shell:scripts:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment.
    We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently
    and save them in files
    so that we can re-run all those operations again later
    by typing a single command.
    For historical reasons,
    a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a <a href="glossary.html#shell-script">shell script</a>,
    but make no mistake:
    these are actually small programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start by putting the following line in the file <code>middle.sh</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
head -20 cholesterol.pdb | tail -5
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This is a variation on the pipe we constructed <a href="#s:pipefilter">earlier</a>:
    it selects lines 15-20 of the file <code>cholesterol.pdb</code>.
    Remember,
    we are <em>not</em> running it as a command just yet:
    we are putting the commands in a file.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Text vs. Whatever</h3>

    <p>
      We usually call programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer "text editors"
      (a more correct name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor">word processor</a>),
      but we need to be a bit more careful when it comes to programming.
      By default,
      Microsoft Word uses <code>.doc</code> (and LibreOffice Writer uses
      <code>.odt</code>) files to store not only text,
      but also formatting information about fonts,
      headings,
      and so on.
      This extra information isn't stored as characters,
      and doesn't mean anything to the shell interpreter:
      it expects input files to contain nothing but the letters, digits, and punctuation
      on a standard computer keyboard.
      When editing programs,
      therefore,
      you must either use a plain text editor,
      or be careful to save files as plain text.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Once we have saved the file,
    we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.
    Our shell is called <code>bash</code>,
    so we run the following command:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1      -1.463  -0.666   1.001  1.00  0.00
ATOM     15  C           1       0.762  -0.929   0.295  1.00  0.00
ATOM     16  C           1       0.771  -0.937   1.840  1.00  0.00
ATOM     17  C           1      -0.664  -0.610   2.293  1.00  0.00
ATOM     18  C           1      -4.705   2.108  -0.396  1.00  0.00</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Sure enough, our script's output is exactly what we would get
    if we ran that pipeline directly.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Running Scripts Without Calling Bash</h3>

    <p>
      We actually don't need to call Bash explicitly
      when we want to run a shell script.
      Instead,
      we can change the permissions on the shell script
      so that the operating system knows it is runnable,
      then put a special line at the start to tell the OS
      what program to use to run it.
      Please see the <a href="extras.html#s:permissions">appendix</a>
      for an explanation of how to do this.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?
    We could edit <code>middle.sh</code> each time to change the filename,
    but that would probably take longer than just retyping the command.
    Instead,
    let's edit <code>middle.sh</code>
    and replace <code>cholesterol.pdb</code> with a special variable called <code>$1</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cat middle.sh</span>
head -20 <span class="highlight">$1</span> | tail -5
</pre>

  <p>
    Inside a shell script,
    <code>$1</code> means "the first filename (or other parameter) on the command line".
    We can now run our script like this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh cholesterol.pdb</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1      -1.463  -0.666   1.001  1.00  0.00
ATOM     15  C           1       0.762  -0.929   0.295  1.00  0.00
ATOM     16  C           1       0.771  -0.937   1.840  1.00  0.00
ATOM     17  C           1      -0.664  -0.610   2.293  1.00  0.00
ATOM     18  C           1      -4.705   2.108  -0.396  1.00  0.00</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    or on a different file like this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh vitamin_a.pdb</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1       1.788  -0.987  -0.861
ATOM     15  C           1       2.994  -0.265  -0.829
ATOM     16  C           1       4.237  -0.901  -1.024
ATOM     17  C           1       5.406  -0.117  -1.087
ATOM     18  C           1      -0.696  -2.628  -0.641</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    We still need to edit <code>middle.sh</code> each time we want to adjust the range of lines, though.
    Let's fix that by using the special variables <code>$2</code> and <code>$3</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cat middle.sh</span>
head <span class="highlight">$2</span> $1 | tail <span class="highlight">$3</span>
$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh vitamin_a.pdb -20 -5</span>
<span class="out">ATOM     14  C           1       1.788  -0.987  -0.861
ATOM     15  C           1       2.994  -0.265  -0.829
ATOM     16  C           1       4.237  -0.901  -1.024
ATOM     17  C           1       5.406  -0.117  -1.087
ATOM     18  C           1      -0.696  -2.628  -0.641</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?
    For example,
    if we want to sort our PDB files by length,
    we would type:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l *.pdb | sort -n</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    because <code>wc&nbsp;-l</code> lists the number of lines in the files,
    and <code>sort&nbsp;-n</code> sorts things numerically.
    We could put this in a file,
    but then it would only ever sort a list of PDB files in the current directory.
    If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files,
    possibly from many sub-directories,
    we need a way to get all those names into the script.
    We can't use <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, and so on
    because we don't know how many files there are.
    Instead,
    we use the special variable <code>$*</code>,
    which means, "All of the command-line parameters to the shell script."
    Here's an example:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cat sorted.sh</span>
<span class="out">wc -l $* | sort -n</span>
$ <span class="in">bash sorted.sh *.dat backup/*.dat</span>
<span class="out">      29 chloratin.dat
      89 backup/chloratin.dat
      91 sphagnoi.dat
     156 sphag2.dat
     172 backup/sphag-merged.dat
     182 girmanis.dat</span>
</pre>

  <div class="box" id="a:not-doing-anything">
    <h3>Why Isn't It Doing Anything?</h3>

    <p>
      What happens if a script is supposed to process a bunch of files,
      but we don't give it any filenames?
      For example,
      what if we type:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash sorted.sh</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      but don't say <code>*.dat</code> (or anything else)?
      In this case,
      <code>$*</code> expands to nothing at all,
      so the pipeline inside the script is effectively:
    </p>

<pre>
wc -l | sort -n
</pre>

    <p>
      Since it doesn't have any filenames,
      <code>wc</code> assumes it is supposed to process standard input,
      so it just sits there and waits for us to give it some data interactively.
      From the outside,
      though,
      all we see is it sitting there:
      the script doesn't appear to do anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now consider a script called <code>distinct.sh</code>:
    </p>

<pre>
sort $* | uniq
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      Let's run it as part of a pipeline without any filenames:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">head -5 *.dat | bash distinct.sh</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      This is equivalent to:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">head -5 *.dat | sort | uniq</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which is actually what we want.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    We have two more things to do
    before we're finished with our simple shell scripts.
    If you look at a script like:
  </p>

<pre>
wc -l $* | sort -n
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    you can probably puzzle out what it does.
    On the other hand,
    if you look at this script:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="comment"># List files sorted by number of lines.</span>
wc -l $* | sort -n
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    you don't have to puzzle it out&mdash;the comment at the top of the script
    tells you what it does.
    A line or two of documentation like this make it much easier for other people
    (including your future self)
    to re-use your work.
    The only caveat is that each time you modify the script,
    you should check that the comment is still accurate:
    an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction
    is worse than none at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    Second,
    suppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful&mdash;for example,
    that created a graph we'd like to use in a paper.
    We'd like to be able to re-create the graph later if we need to,
    so we want to save the commands in a file.
    Instead of typing them in again
    (and potentially getting them wrong),
    we can do this:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">history | tail -4 &gt; redo-figure-3.sh</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The file <code>redo-figure-3.sh</code> now contains:
  </p>

<pre>
 297 goostats -r NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
 298 goodiff stats-NENE01729B.txt /data/validated/01729.txt &gt; 01729-differences.txt
 299 cut -d ',' -f 2-3 01729-differences.txt &gt; 01729-time-series.txt
 300 ygraph --format scatter --color bw --borders none 01729-time-series.txt figure-3.png
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    After a moment's work in an editor to remove the serial numbers on the command,
    we have a completely accurate record of how we created that figure.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Unnumbering</h3>
    <p>
      Nelle could also use <code>colrm</code>
      (short for "column removal")
      to remove the serial numbers on her previous commands.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    In practice,
    most people develop shell scripts by running commands at the shell prompt a few times
    to make sure they're doing something useful,
    and doing it correctly,
    then saving them in a file for re-use.
    This style of work allows people to recycle what they discover
    about their data and their workflow
    with just a few extra keystrokes.
  </p>

  <div>
    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Creating a Script</h3>

    <p>
      An off-hand comment from her supervisor has made Nelle realize that
      she should have provided a couple of extra parameters to <code>goostats</code>
      when she processed her files.
      This might have been a disaster if she had done all the analysis by hand,
      but thanks to for loops,
      it will only take a couple of hours to re-do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Experience has taught her,
      though,
      that if something needs to be done twice,
      it will probably need to be done a third or fourth time as well.
      She runs the editor and writes the following:
    </p>

<pre>
# Calculate reduced stats for data files at J = 100 c/bp.
for datafile in $*
do
    echo $datafile
    goostats -J 100 -r $datafile stats-$datafile
done
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      (The parameters <code>-J&nbsp;100</code> and <code>-r</code>
      are the ones her supervisor said she should have used.)
      She saves this in a file called <code>do-stats.sh</code>,
      so that she can now re-do the first stage of her analysis by typing:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      She can also do this:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt | wc -l</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      so that the output is just the number of files processed,
      rather than the names of the files that were processed.
    </p>

    <p>
      One thing to note about Nelle's script is
      her choice to let the person running it decide what files to process.
      She could have written the script as:
    </p>

<pre>
# Calculate reduced stats for  A and Site B data files at J = 100 c/bp.
for datafile in <span class="highlight">*[AB].txt</span>
do
    echo $datafile
    goostats -J 100 -r $datafile stats-$datafile
done
</pre>

    <p>
      The advantage is that this always selects the right files:
      she doesn't have to remember to exclude the 'Z' files.
      The disadvantage is that it <em>always</em> selects just those files&mdash;she
      can't run it on all files (including the 'Z' files),
      or on the 'G' or 'H' files her colleagues in Antarctica are producing,
      without editing the script.
      If she wanted to be more adventurous,
      she could modify her script to check for command-line parameters,
      and use <code>*[AB].txt</code> if none were provided.
      Of course,
      this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity;
      we'll explore this <a href="quality.html">later</a>.

  Write a shell script called <code>species.sh</code>
  that takes any number of filenames as command-line parameters,
  and uses <code>cut</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>uniq</code>
  to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of those files separately.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
<p>
  Write a shell script called <code>longest.sh</code>
  that takes the name of a directory and a filename extension as its parameters,
  and prints out the name of the most recently modified file in that directory
  with that extension.
  For example:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash largest.sh /tmp/data pdb</span>
</pre>

<p>
  would print the name of the PDB file in <code>/tmp/data</code>

<p>
  If you run the command:
</p>

<p>
  the last command in the file is the <code>history</code> command itself,
  i.e.,
  the shell has added <code>history</code> to the command log
  before actually running it.
  In fact,
  the shell <em>always</em> adds commands to the log before running them.

  </figure>

  <p>
    You can often guess someone's age by listening to how people talk about search
    (<a href="#f:google_vs_grep">Figure 17</a>).
    Just as young people use "Google" as a verb,
    crusty old Unix programmers use "grep".
    The word is a contraction of "global/regular expression/print",
    a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.
    It is also the name of a very useful command-line program.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>grep</code> finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.
    For our examples,
    we will use a file that contains three haikus
    taken from a <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/chal/1998/01/26chal.html">1998 competition in Salon magazine</a>:
  </p>

<pre>
The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
</pre>

  <p>
    Let's find lines that contain the word "not":
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep not haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">Is not the true Tao, until
"My Thesis" not found
Today it is not working</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Here, <code>not</code> is the pattern we're searching for.
    It's pretty simple: every alphanumeric character matches against itself.
    After the pattern comes the name or names of the files we're searching in.
    The output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters "not".
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's try a different pattern: "day".
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep day haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This time,
    the output is lines containing the words "Yesterday" and "Today",
    which both have the letters "day".
    If we give <code>grep</code> the <code>-w</code> flag,
    it restricts matches to word boundaries,
    so that only lines with the word "day" will be printed:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -w day haiku.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    In this case, there aren't any, so <code>grep</code>'s output is empty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another useful option is <code>-n</code>, which numbers the lines that match:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -n it haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">5:With searching comes loss
9:Yesterday it worked
10:Today it is not working</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Here, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters "it".

  <p>
    As with other Unix commands, we can combine flags.
    For example,
    since <code>-i</code> makes matching case-insensitive,
    and <code>-v</code> inverts the match,
    using them both only prints lines that <em>don't</em> match the pattern
    in any mix of upper and lower case:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -i -v the haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">You bring fresh toner.

    <code>grep</code> has lots of other options.
    To find out what they are, we can type <code>man grep</code>.
    <code>man</code> is the Unix "manual" command.
    It prints a description of a command and its options,
    and (if you're lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">man grep</span>
<span class="out">GREP(1)                                                                                              GREP(1)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines matching a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
       grep [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-
       minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  By default, grep
       prints the matching lines.
       &hellip;        &hellip;        &hellip;

OPTIONS
   Generic Program Information
       --help Print  a  usage  message  briefly summarizing these command-line options and the bug-reporting
              address, then exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of grep to the standard output stream.  This version number should be
              included in all bug reports (see below).

   Matcher Selection
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERN  as  an  extended regular expression (ERE, see below).  (-E is specified by
              POSIX.)

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of  which  is  to  be
              matched.  (-F is specified by POSIX.)
    &hellip;        &hellip;        &hellip;</span>

    <h3>Wildcards</h3>

    <p>
      <code>grep</code>'s real power doesn't come from its options, though;
      it comes from the fact that patterns can include wildcards.
      (The technical name for these is
      <a href="glossary.html#regular-expression">regular expressions</a>,
      which is what the "re" in "grep" stands for.)
      Regular expressions are complex enough that
      we devoted an entire section of the website to them;
      if you want to do complex searches,
      please check it out.
      As a taster,
      we can find lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -E '^.o' haiku.txt</span>
You bring fresh toner.
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      We use the <code>-E</code> flag and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell from trying to interpret it.
      (If the pattern contained a '*', for example, the shell would try to expand it before running <code>grep</code>.)
      The '^' in the pattern anchors the match to the start of the line.
      The '.' matches a single character
      (just like '?' in the shell),
      while the 'o' matches an actual 'o'.
    </p>
    
  </div>

  <p>
    While <code>grep</code> finds lines in files,
    the <code>find</code> command finds files themselves.
    Again, it has a lot of options;
    to show how the simplest ones work, we'll use the directory tree in
    <a href="#f:find_file_tree">Figure 18</a>:
  </p>

  <figure id="f:find_file_tree">
    <img src="{{page.root}}/img/lessons/swc-shell/find_file_tree.png" alt="Sample Files and Directories" />
    <figcaption>Figure 18: Sample Files and Directories</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="continue">
    Vlad's home directory contains one file called <code>notes.txt</code> and four subdirectories:
    <code>thesis</code> (which is sadly empty),
    <code>data</code> (which contains two files <code>first.txt</code> and <code>second.txt</code>),
    a <code>tools</code> directory that contains the programs <code>format</code> and <code>stats</code>,
    and an empty subdirectory called <code>old</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For our first command, let's run <code>find . -type d</code>.
    <code>.</code> is the directory where we want our search to start;
    <code>-type&nbsp;d</code> means "things that are directories".
    Sure enough,
    <code>find</code>'s output is the names of the five directories in our little tree
    (including <code>.</code>, the current working directory):
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -type d</span>
<span class="out">./
./data
./thesis
./tools
./tools/old</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    If we change <code>-type&nbsp;d</code> to <code>-type&nbsp;f</code>,
    we get a listing of all the files instead:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -type f</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./notes.txt
./tools/format
./tools/stats</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>find</code> automatically goes into subdirectories,
    their subdirectories,
    and so on to find everything that matches the pattern we've given it.
    If we don't want it to,
    we can use <code>-maxdepth</code> to restrict the depth of search:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -maxdepth 1 -type f</span>
<span class="out">./notes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    The opposite of <code>-maxdepth</code> is <code>-mindepth</code>,
    which tells <code>find</code> to only report things that are at or below a certain depth.
    <code>-mindepth&nbsp;2</code> therefore finds all the files that are two or more levels below us:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -mindepth 2 -type f</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./tools/format
./tools/stats</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Another option is <code>-empty</code>,
    which restricts matches to empty files and directories:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -empty</span>
<span class="out">./thesis
./tools/old</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Now let's try matching by name:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -name *.txt</span>
<span class="out">./notes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    We expected it to find all the text files,
    but it only prints out <code>./notes.txt</code>.
    The problem is that the shell expands wildcard characters like <code>*</code> <em>before</em> commands run.
    Since <code>*.txt</code> in the current directory expands to <code>notes.txt</code>,
    the command we actually ran was:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -name notes.txt</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>find</code> did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get what we want,
    let's do what we did with <code>grep</code>:
    put <code>*.txt</code> in single quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the <code>*</code> wildcard.
    This way,
    <code>find</code> actually gets the pattern <code>*.txt</code>,
    not the expanded filename <code>notes.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -name '*.txt'</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./notes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    As we said <a href="#s:pipefilter">earlier</a>,
    the command line's power lies in combining tools.
    We've seen how to do that with pipes; let's look at another technique.
    As we just saw, <code>find . -name '*.txt'</code> gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory.
    How can we combine that with <code>wc -l</code> to count the lines in all those files?
  </p>

  <p>
    One way is to put the <code>find</code> command inside <code>$()</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt')</span>
<span class="out">  70  ./data/first.txt
 420  ./data/second.txt
  30  ./notes.txt
 520  total</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    When the shell executes this command,
    the first thing it does is run whatever is inside the <code>$()</code>.
    It then replaces the <code>$()</code> expression with that command's output.
    Since the output of <code>find</code> is the three filenames
    <code>./data/first.txt</code>, <code>./data/second.txt</code>, and <code>./notes.txt</code>,
    the shell constructs the command:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l ./data/first.txt ./data/second.txt ./notes.txt</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    which is what we wanted.
    This expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>,
    but lets us use any command we want as our own "wildcard".
  </p>

  <p>
    It's very common to use <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> together.
    The first finds files that match a pattern;
    the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.
    Here, for example, we can find PDB files that contain iron atoms
    by looking for the string "FE" in all the <code>.pdb</code> files below the current directory:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep FE $(find . -name '*.pdb')</span>
<span class="out">./human/heme.pdb:ATOM  25  FE  1  -0.924  0.535  -0.518</span>
$
</pre>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Binary Files</h3>

    <p>
      We have focused exclusively on finding things in text files.
      What if your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?
      One option would be to extend tools like <code>grep</code> to handle those formats.
      This hasn't happened, and probably won't, because there are too many formats to support.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second option is to convert the data to text,
      or extract the text-ish bits from the data.
      This is probably the most common approach,
      since it only requires people to build one tool per data format (to extract information).
      On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to do.
      On the negative side, complex things are usually impossible.
      For example,
      it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y dimensions from image files for <code>grep</code> to play with,
      but how would you write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained formulas?
    </p>

    <p>
      The third choice is to recognize that the shell and text processing have their limits,
      and to use a programming language such as Python instead.
      When the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell:
      many modern programming languages, Python included, have borrowed a lot of ideas from it,
      and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: The Second Stage</h3>

    <p>
      Nelle now has a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code>
      containing 1518 data files,
      and needs to compare each one against all of the others
      to find the hundred pairs with the highest pairwise scores.
      Armed with what she has learned so far,
      she writes the following script
    </p>

<pre>
# Compare all pairs of files.
for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        echo $left $right $(goodiff $left $right)
    done
done
</pre>

    <p>
      The outermost loop assigns the name of each file to the variable <code>left</code> in turn.
      The inner loop does the same thing for the variable <code>right</code>
      each time the outer loop executes,
      so inside the inner loop,
      <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> are given
      each pair of filenames.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each time it runs the command inside the inner loop,
      the shell starts by running <code>goodiff</code> on the two files
      in order to expand the <code>$()</code> expression.
      Once it's done that,
      it passes the output,
      along with the names of the files,
      to <code>echo</code>.
      Thus,
      if Nelle saves this script as <code>pairwise.sh</code>
      and runs it as:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash pairwise.sh stats-*.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      the shell runs:
    </p>

<pre>
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt $(goodiff stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt)
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt $(goodiff stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt)
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt $(goodiff stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt)
...
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which turns into:
    </p>

<pre>
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt files are identical
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt 0.97182
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt 0.45223
...
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which in turn prints:
    </p>

<pre>
stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt files are identical
stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt 0.97182
stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt 0.45223
...
</pre>

    <p>
      That's a good start,
      but Nelle can do better.
      First,
      she notices that when the two input files are the same,
      the output is the words "files are identical"
      instead of a numerical score.
      She can remove these lines like this:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash pairwise.sh stats-*.txt | grep -v 'files are identical'</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      or put the call to <code>grep</code> inside the shell script
      (which will be less error-prone):
    </p>

<pre>
for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        echo $left $right $(goodiff $left $right)
    done
done <span class="highlight">| grep -v 'files are identical'</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      This works because <code>do</code>&hellip;<code>done</code>
      counts as a single command in Bash.
      If Nelle wanted to make this clearer,
      she could put parentheses around the loop:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="highlight">(</span>for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        echo $left $right $(goodiff $left $right)
    done
done<span class="highlight">)</span> | grep -v 'files are identical'
</pre>

    <p>
      The last thing Nelle needs to do before writing up
      is find the 100 best pairwise matches.
      She has seen this before:
      sort the lines numerically,
      then use <code>head</code> to select the top lines.
      However,
      the numbers she wants to sort by are at the end of the line,
      rather than beginning.
      Reading the output of <code>man&nbsp;sort</code> tells her
      that the <code>-k</code> flag will let her specify
      which column of input she wants to use as a sort key,
      but the syntax looks a little complicated.
      Instead,
      she moves the score to the front of each line:
    </p>

<pre>
(for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        <span class="highlight">echo $(goodiff $left $right) $left $right</span>
    done
done) | grep -v 'files are identical'
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and then adds two more commands to the pipeline:
    </p>

<pre>
(for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        <span class="highlight">echo $(goodiff $left $right) $left $right</span>
    done
done) | grep -v 'files are identical' | sort -n -r | head -100
</pre>

    <p>
      Since this is hard to read,
      she uses <code>\</code> to tell the shell
      that she's continuing commands on the next line:
    </p>

<pre>
(for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        <span class="highlight">echo $(goodiff $left $right) $left $right</span>
    done
done) \
| grep -v 'files are identical' \
| sort -n -r \
| head -100
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      She then runs:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash pairwise.sh stats-*.txt &gt; top100.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and heads off to a seminar,
      confident that by the time she comes back tomorrow,
      <code>top100.txt</code> will contain
      the results she needs for her paper.
    </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

<div id="s:shell:summary">

  <p>
    The Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it.
    It has survived so long because it is
    one of the most productive programming environments ever created&mdash;maybe even
    <em>the</em> most productive.
    Its syntax may be cryptic,
    but people who have mastered it can experiment with different commands interactively,
    then use what they have learned to automate their work.
    Graphical user interfaces may be better at the first,
    but the shell is still unbeaten at the second.
    And as Alfred North Whitehead wrote in 1911,
    "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them."
