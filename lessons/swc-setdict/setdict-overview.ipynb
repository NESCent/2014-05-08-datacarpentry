      "\n",
      "The ostensible goal of this set of lessons is to introduce learners to\n",
      "non-linear data structures. Most have ony ever seen arrays or lists,\n",
      "i.e., things that are accessed using sequential numeric indices. Sets\n",
      "and dictionaries are usually their first exposure to accessing content\n",
      "by value rather than by location, and to the bigger idea that there are\n",
      "lots of other data structures they might want to learn about.\n",
      "(Unfortunately, there still isn't a good data structure handbook for\n",
      "Python programmers that we can point them at.)\n",
      "\n",
      "These lessons also introduce JSON as a general-purpose data format that\n",
      "requires less effort to work with than flat text or CSV. We discuss its\n",
      "shortcomings as well as its benefits to help learners see what forces\n",
      "are at play when designing and/or choosing data representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, these lessons are also our first chance to introduce the idea\n",
      "of computational complexity via back-of-the-envelope calculations of how\n",
      "the number of steps required to look things up in an unordered list\n",
      "grows with the number of things being looked up. We return to this idea\n",
      "in the [extended example of invasion percolation](dev.html), and to the\n",
      "notion that algorithmic improvements help more than tuning code, but\n",
      "this is a chance to touch on the idea in classes that don't get to that\n",
      "example. The discussion of hash tables is also good preparation for the\n",
      "discussion of [relational databases](db.html), but isn't required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything in this lesson except the final example on phylogenetic trees\n",
      "can be covered in two hours, assuming that only three short exercises\n",
      "are given (one for sets, one for basic dictionary operations, and one\n",
      "related to aggregation).\n",
      "\n",
      "-   Start with sets: they're a familiar concept, there's no confusion\n",
      "    between keys and values, and they are enough to motivate discussion\n",
      "    of hash tables.\n",
      "-   Python's requirement that entries in hash-based data structures be\n",
      "    immutable only makes sense once the mechanics of hash tables are\n",
      "    explained. Terms like \"hash codes\" and \"hash function\" also come up\n",
      "    in error messages and Python's documentation, so learners are likely\n",
      "    to become confused without some kind of hand-waving overview. Tuples\n",
      "    are also easy to explain as \"how to create immutable multi-part\n",
      "    keys\", and it's easy to explain why entries can't be looked up by\n",
      "    parts (e.g., why a tuple containing a first and a last name can't be\n",
      "    looked up by last name only) in terms of hash functions.\n",
      "-   Finally, explaining why hash tables are fast is a good first\n",
      "    encounter with the idea of \"big oh\" complexity.\n",
      "-   Once sets have been mastered, dictionaries can be explained as \"sets\n",
      "    with extra information attached to each entry\". The canonical\n",
      "    example\u2014counting things\u2014shows why that \"extra information\" is\n",
      "    useful. The original motivating problem then uses both a dictionary\n",
      "    and a dictionary of dictionaries; when introducing the latter,\n",
      "    compare it to a list of lists.\n",
      "-   Use the nanotechnology inventory example to re-emphasize how code is\n",

      "    filling them in.\n",
      "-   Only tackle the phylogenetic tree example with very advanced\n",
      "    learners. The algorithm is usually presented as a table, which makes\n",
      "    an array a natural representation. Showing how and why to use\n",
      "    dictionaries instead is as important as showing vector operations\n",
      "    when introducing NumPy, but the example is hard to follow (and\n",
