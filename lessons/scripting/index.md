title: Unix Shell Scripting
---

The Unix shell is a power tool that allows people to do complex things
with just a few keystrokes. However, more importantly for those trying
to work more efficiently with data, the Unix shell allows combining
existing programs in new ways, and to create automated executable data
pipelines that can be repeated, modified, and built upon.
