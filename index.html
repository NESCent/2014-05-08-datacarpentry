<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain.
</p>
<p>
Our curriculum includes:
<ul>
<li>  Day 1 morning: Getting data out of Excel and into more powerful tools
<li>  Day 1 afternoon: Managing data in R.
<li>  Day 2 morning: Introduction to databases, combining and querying data using SQL.
<li>  Day 2 afternoon: Collaborative data management & publishing data.
</ul>
The concepts, skills, and tools we teach are domain-independent, but example problem cases and datasets will be taken from organismal and evolutionary biology, biodiversity science, ecology, and environmental science. 
</p>

<p>
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are required to bring their own laptops.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance, and NESCent does have a few loaner laptops if you can't bring one.) <emph>There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.</emph>
