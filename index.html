<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
<p>
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic lab skills for computing
  like program design, version control, data management, and task automation.
  This two-day hands-on bootcamp will cover basic concepts and tools;
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
</p>
-->

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. 
<p>
Our curriculum includes:
<ul>
<li>  Day 1 morning: Getting data out of Excel and into more powerful tools
<li>  Day 1 afternoon: Managing data in R.
<li>  Day 2 morning: Introduction to databases, combining and querying data using SQL.
<li>  Day 2 afternoon: Collaborative data management & publishing data.
</ul>

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are required to bring their own laptops.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance, and NESCent does have a few loaner laptops if you can't bring one.) There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools. 
<p>
Data Carpentry is a partnership of the NSF-funded BIO Centers (NESCent, iPlant, iDigBio, BEACON and SESYNC) and Software Carpentry and is sponsored by the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE). See <a href=http://software-carpentry.org>http://software-carpentry.org</a> for information about Software Carpentry.
